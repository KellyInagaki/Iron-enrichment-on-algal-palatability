INFLUENCE OF SEAWATER ENRICHMENT WITH DISSOLVED IRON ON ALGAL PALATABILITY TO HERBIVORES

In this study we tested the effects of seawater enrichment with iron on algal palatability to reef herbivores, in a 28-days mesocosm experiment.

Here we provide the database, consisting of (each tab):
- Algae_biomass: data on algal photosynthetic measurements and biomass during the exposition to iron enrichment
- Algae_CN: data on carbon:nitrogen rates of algae taken during the exposition to iron enrichment
- Ampihpods: data on enriched algal consumption by amphipods
- Sea urchins: data on enriched algal consumption by sea urchins
- Reef fish: data on enriched algal consumption by sea urchins
- UVC: data of underwater visual census for reef fish
